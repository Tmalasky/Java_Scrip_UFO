# Java_Scrip_UFO

## Background
### Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Overview
### To create multiple filters, I refactored our index.html file and added the filters for City, State, Country, and Shape by taking our original code for the date and changing it and removing the button for just the one filter for multiple filters. I then had to create a new function to loop through the dataset to find the results the matched the filtered search results you entered in. I used an if-else statement to check values that were changed by the input filters.

## Results
### You can access the webpage and search by typing in any Dates, States, Cities, Countries, and or Shapes and the articles will be filtered by what your input is. Here is a look at the webpage’s finale look with all the filters.

## Summary
### One drawback I find by using this website is we don’t have a filter for the Duration, and it might make searching for certain reports easier for some users. Also, we could add a filter for the comments to find certain reports also using key words.
